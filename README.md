# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains from-scratch implementation of common machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, Neural Networks and Backpropagation, etc...

Some parts of the implementation will utilize Numpy, for algos I haven't completely figured out yet.


Feel free to use and experiment however you like.
